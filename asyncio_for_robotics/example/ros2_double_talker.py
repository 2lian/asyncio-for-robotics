"""
Example ROS 2 publishers using asyncio integration.

This example demonstrates how to:
- Safely create and destroy publishers using `auto_session().lock()`.
- Publish messages asynchronously at regular intervals with non-blocking
  `asyncio.sleep`.
- Run multiple publishers concurrently and cancel them dynamically.
- Ensure cleanup of publishers when tasks are cancelled or errors occur,
  which is especially useful for testing scenarios with short-lived
  publishers and subscribers.

The script alternates between running:
  - Publisher #1 alone.
  - Publisher #1 and Publisher #2 together.
  - Only Publisher #2.

Run this script using `python3 -m asyncio_for_robotics.example.ros2_double_talker`
Run this script side by side with `python3 -m asyncio_for_robotics.example.ros2_double_listener`

"""
Example ROS 2 subscriber using asyncio integration.

This example demonstrates how to:
- Subscribe to multiple ROS 2 topics concurrently with asyncio.
- React immediately to the first new message from any topic.
- Use `soft_timeout` to wait briefly for additional messages while still
  resuming as soon as all subscriptions have received data.
- Distinguish between new and previously received messages.
- Safely retrieve the most recent values even if one topic has never
  produced data.

Run this script using `python3 -m asyncio_for_robotics.example.ros2_double_listener`
Run this script side by side with `python3 -m asyncio_for_robotics.example.ros2_double_talker`
